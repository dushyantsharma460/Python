# 📘 Learning Python Programming

Welcome to my Python programming learning repository!  
This project is a collection of notes, code snippets, mini-projects, and exercises that I'm working on while learning Python.

## 🐍 About Python
Python is a powerful, easy-to-learn, and versatile programming language widely used in:
- Web development
- Data science
- Machine learning
- Automation
- Game development
- and more!

## 📚 What I’m Learning

Here are the topics I'm covering step-by-step:

- ✅ Python Basics (variables, data types, input/output)
- ✅ Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- ✅ Loops (`for`, `while`)
- ✅ Functions and Scope
- ✅ Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
- ⏳ File Handling
- ⏳ Exception Handling
- ⏳ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ⏳ Modules and Packages
- ⏳ Libraries (like `math`, `datetime`, `random`, etc.)
- ⏳ Mini Projects and Practice Problems

> I will update this list as I continue learning!
